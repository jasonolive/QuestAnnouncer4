# [QuestAnnouncer4][qa4]

Imagine that you are questing with a friend and you are killing Nagas together but you think they might be too far away and didn't get credit. Enter QuestAnnouncer4...

QA4 gives you the opportunity to send an announcement to your group showing them as you accept, progress, complete or even fail a quest.

When you accept a quest a message occurs on your friends screen in the UI INFO area (where Raid Warnings and Error message occur) telling them that you have accepted the quest. As you make progress on it they will get the messages as well. When you complete it, they'll know. Of course, to get this both party members will need to be running QA4. For your friends that don't have the addon, there is an option to output these messages to party chat.

Usage: /qa4 will load the config window.
